# Lexical Analysis

## Theory
    - Take source code and generate tokens.
    - tokens are:
        1 identifiers
        2 keywords
        3 special symbols
        4 operators
        5 constants
    - Error detection and display

## Todo List
    [x] Headers and basic definition
    [x] Regular expressions written
    [x] Basic user routine done
    [ ] Advanced user routine function
    [ ] Error detections
    [ ] bash file creation
